The goal of this project is to use React to create the client side/front end counterpart of the full IFDb web app based on its
existing server-side code located [here](https://github.com/SimeonTu/movie-app) (REST API and database).
The IFDb web app is intended to help people find information about their favorite movies. Users can filter movies by name, genre, actors or directors, and add register for an account and add movies to their favorites.

This app uses the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).
